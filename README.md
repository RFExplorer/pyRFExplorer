pyRFE - RF Explorer GUI in Python
=======

This is experimental code and most likely unfit for your purposes. It has been developed on an RF Explorer USB 3G model, but should run on others as well.

## Requirements

You need to have the SI-Labs driver installed.

* pip install pyserial
* pip install numpy
* pip install matplotlib

## Usage

Connect the RX Explorer via USB, set it to spectrum analyser mode, edit the main rfe.py script to use the proper tty device for your system, and run ./rfe.py
